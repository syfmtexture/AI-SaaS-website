# Quick.ai ⚡️

Just another AI wrapper SaaS because apparently the world needs more of these. It's a full-stack PERN app that basically lets users generate cool stuff with AI until they hit a paywall.

## The Vibe (Overview)

It's a SaaS. It uses AI. It takes people's money.
We hooked up Gemini and ClipDrop to a React frontend and a Node backend so people can feel productive.

## 🧰 The Stack (Stuff I suffered with)

* **Frontend:** React (Vite because CRA is dead, RIP), Tailwind (because CSS is hard), Clerk (I'm not building auth from scratch, are you crazy?).
* **Backend:** Node/Express (it just works), PostgreSQL via Neon (serverless ftw).
* **AI Magic:** Gemini API for text, ClipDrop for images.
* **Storage:** Cloudinary (for storing all those generated memes).

## 🔥 Features (The good stuff)

* **Login/Signup:** Works with Google so you don't have to remember passwords.
* **Paywall:** Integrated billing so you can actually make that bag 💰.
* **AI Tools:**
    * Make articles (for lazy bloggers).
    * Remove backgrounds (RIP Photoshop).
    * Erase objects from pics (bye bye exes).
    * Roast... I mean, "review" resumes.
* **Community Feed:** Flex your AI art for internet points.

🙏
